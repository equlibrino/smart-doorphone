### Materials;
## ESP8266 Wifi Serial Module
## 5v 2 Channel Relay Module
## Ams1117 3.3v Voltage Regulator Module
## 5x10 Perforated Pertinax
## 2x4 Pin Header Female
## 4 Pin Tact Switch - 6x6x6.5mm

### The goal of the project
- Thanks to Sinric Pro, you can open your apartment door with a single button, wherever you are in the world.
- First, channel 1 is turned on - the doorphone screen works - then channel 2 is turned on and the door opens.

### You must not forget
- Sinric has no buttons, only buttons, which causes the following problem; Even if I turn off the relay from the software, the switch still shows up in Sinric, so you should turn on [aut off](image/auto_off.png).

**Don't know how to install software on the module?**
