### The goal of the project
- Thanks to Sinric Pro, you can open your apartment door with a single button, wherever you are in the world.
- First, channel 1 is turned on - the doorphone screen works - then channel 2 is turned on and the door opens.

### You shouldn't forget
- There is no button in Sinric, you need to activate the automatic shut-off with key.
Because he always remains open to the role.
