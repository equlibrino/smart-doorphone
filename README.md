### The goal of the project
- Thanks to Sinric Pro, you can open your apartment door with a single button, wherever you are in the world.
- First, channel 1 is turned on - the doorphone screen works - then channel 2 is turned on and the door opens.

### You must not forget
- Sinric has no buttons, only buttons, which causes the following problem; Even if I turn off the relay from the software, the switch still shows up in Sinric, so you should turn on [aut ooff](image/auto_off.png).

**Don't know how to install software on the module?**
